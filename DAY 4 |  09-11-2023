ASCII Character Set vs UTF-8 Character Set vs UTF-16 Character Set
  
ASCII, UTF-8, and UTF-16 are all character encodings. ASCII is the oldest and simplest, while UTF-8 and UTF-16 are more complex and can encode a wider range of characters.
ASCII can only encode 128 characters, which is not enough to represent all the characters used in the world's languages. UTF-8 can encode up to 65,536 characters, and UTF-16 can encode up to 1,114,111 characters.
UTF-8 is the most commonly used character encoding today. It is a variable-width encoding, which means that each character can take up one, two, three, or four bytes. UTF-16 is a fixed-width encoding, which means that each character always takes up two bytes.
UTF-8 is more efficient than UTF-16 because it uses fewer bytes to encode characters. However, UTF-16 is more compatible with older systems because it is a fixed-width encoding.
Here is a table that shows the differences between ASCII, UTF-8, and UTF-16:

Difference between Framework and API?

Framework
A framework is a set of pre-built code that provides a structure for developing software applications. It can include things like libraries, tools, and templates. Frameworks can help developers save time and effort by providing a starting point for their projects.

API
An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that allow two pieces of software to communicate with each other. APIs can be used to share data, functionality, and other resources between applications.
Here are some of the key differences between frameworks and APIs:
Frameworks provide a structure for developing software applications, while APIs allow two pieces of software to communicate with each other.
Frameworks are typically used by developers, while APIs can be used by developers and end users.
Frameworks are typically more complex than APIs.
Frameworks are typically more tightly coupled with the applications they are used to develop, while APIs are typically more loosely coupled.
